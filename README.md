# Project Title
Predicting Food Waste with AI
## Summary
WastePredict(WP) is an AI-powered application designed to predict and reduce food waste at the household level. By analyzing individual consumption patterns and shopping habits, the app provides insights and recommendations to minimize waste. 
## Background
Problem: Food waste is a significant global issue, contributing to environmental degradation and economic loss. Households often over-purchase or mismanage food, leading to waste.
1. Over-Purchasing and Improper Planning: Many households in Southeast Asia tend to over-purchase food due to cultural habits, promotional offers, and a lack of proper meal planning. This results in excess food that is often not consumed and eventually wasted.
2. Lack of Awareness and Education on Food Waste: Problem: Many households are not fully aware of the impact of food waste or how to minimize it. This lack of awareness leads to poor food storage practices, misunderstanding of expiration dates, and failure to utilize leftovers. In urban areas of Indonesia and Vietnam, households often throw away food that is still safe to eat because they misunderstand the terms "best before" and "use by". 
3. Inadequate Storage Facilities: Many rural households in Southeast Asia lack adequate storage facilities, such as refrigerators and proper containers, to keep food fresh for longer periods. This leads to quicker spoilage and waste of perishable items.
